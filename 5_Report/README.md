## WIPERCONTROLSYSTEM
A Wiper Speed Control System Controls the operational speed of the wiper in accordance with the rain condition. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all types of vehicles the main purpose is to clean the rain air drops present in front screen of the vehicles. It is very difficult to drive the vehicles in rain condition so in this case we will use wipers to clean the front screen of vehicles which is mirror so that we can drive the vehicles even in rain also.

Wiper is an essential component that used to wipe raindrops or any water from the vehicleâ€™s windscreen. The previous system used to activate the wiper manually and the process of pulling up the wiper is difficult to be handled. Thus, this system is proposed to solve these problems. The objectives of this project are to upgrade the older cars system by providing automatic wiping system, to improve the system by using sensor with actuator and to design a basic program that will fully operate with the system. The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. As the conclusion for the project, the results shows all the aim objectives are successfully achieved. The wiper system was well functionally according the water condition from the outside of a car. This project showed a contribution on the design of the automatic wiper system for the future research in this same field. It is recommended that the system to have a study on the wiper material that been used to make a wiper because the driver at hot and climate country are facing the problems regards to the wiper material.


## Introduction
A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a gadget used to eliminate downpour and flotsam and jetsam from a windscreen. Practically all engine vehicle, including trains, airplane and watercraft, are outfitted with such wipers, which are generally a fundamental prerequisite. A wiper for the most part comprises of an arm, turning toward one side and with a long elastic sharp edge connected to the next. The edge is swung to and fro over the glass, pushing water from its surface. The speed is ordinarily customizable, with a few constant paces and frequently at least one "intermittent"settings. Most automobilesuse two synchronized outspread sort arms. It takes a great deal of power to speed up the wiper sharp edges to and fro across the windshield so rapidly. To create this sort of power, a worm gear is utilized on the result of a little electric engine.

## SWOT- Strengths, and Weakness, Opportunities Threats:

## Strengths
Agreeable, Easy to utilize, Fast and exactness activity, Easy transportation

## Weakness
High cost,the wiper does not stop in the middle of the window during drive.

## Opportunities
It is an advanced System.

## Threat
Once the board repaired cannot be replaced quickly

## 4W's and 1'H:
## WHO :-
Any client who is going in the vehicle can utilize this framework.

## WHAT :-
Its a Body control model of a vehicle which depicts various elements

## WHEN :-
There is a prerequisite of vehicle these frameworks are utilized

## WHERE:-
Used in Modern And Luxury cars
